# braxscan
this is backdoor checking system in garry'smod addons

this script was not made by me but unfortunately i can't find the original owner, it was just edited by Zaros (GCA) to add a permission check when launching braxscan.
i decided to deploy this addon on my github so that it gains visibility and helps people who have backdoor in their addons.

the addon is not very well optimized but works without a hitch, free to modify it..

INSTALLATION:
throw the 'braxscan-master' folder into the 'addon' folder

COMMANDS:
To scan all addons: braxscan all 1 (ingame console)
